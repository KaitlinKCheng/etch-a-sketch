# Etch-A-Sketch
A project from [The Odin Project's curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project).

This is a browser version of an Etch-A-Sketch that lets the user fill in the squares by mousing over them.

[Live demo here](https://kaitlinkcheng.github.io/etch-a-sketch/).
